# Plotly-Belly Button Biodiversity

# Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity) which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels, using Plotly, the JavaScript open source graphing library. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
